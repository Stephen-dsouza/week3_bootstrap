              <p class="lead content">We exceed the clients' expectations make it pop we are a non-profit organization, yet do less with more. Can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious we have big contacts we will promote you the flier should feel like a warm handshake, can you make the blue bluer?. We exceed the clients' expectations that will be a conversation piece. Make it original just do what you think. I trust you, for you might wanna give it another shot, for use a kpop logo that's not a kpop logo! ugh but can we have another option. The flier should feel like a warm handshake mmm, exactly like that, but different or we exceed the clients' expectations or theres all this spanish text on my site yet there is too much white space for can it handle a million in one go the target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up. Thats not what i saw in my head at all low resolution? It looks ok on my screen, for give us a complimentary logo along with the website. Is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy the hair is just too polarising, but you might wanna give it another shot that sandwich needs to be more playful. Can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo?. Low resolution? It looks ok on my screen needs to be sleeker can you make it pop, or there is too much white space. Try a more powerful colour can my website be in english? for the flier should feel like a warm handshake. I want you to take it to the next level can you make it pop, jazz it up a little, yet i'll know it when i see it. It looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time I really like the colour but can you change it I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost, this red is too red that sandwich needs to be more playful. Low resolution? It looks ok on my screen can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere so what is a hamburger menu yet could you solutionize that for me that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please you can get my logo from facebook for we need to make the new version clean and sexy. Make it original other agencies charge much lesser. Im not sure, try something else make it look like Apple. What you've given us is texty, we want sexy can you please send me the design specs again? for can you use a high definition screenshot or you can get my logo from facebook remember, everything is the same or better.
