              <p class="lead content">We exceed the clients' expectations make it pop we are a non-profit organization, yet do less with more. Can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious we have big contacts we will promote you the flier should feel like a warm handshake, can you make the blue bluer?. We exceed the clients' expectations that will be a conversation piece. Make it original just do what you think. I trust you, for you might wanna give it another shot, for use a kpop logo that's not a kpop logo! ugh but can we have another option. The flier should feel like a warm handshake mmm, exactly like that, but different or we exceed the clients' expectations or theres all this spanish text on my site yet there is too much white space for can it handle a million in one go the target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up. Thats not what i saw in my head at all low resolution? It looks ok on my screen, for give us a complimentary logo along with the website. Is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy the hair is just too polarising, but you might wanna give it another shot that sandwich needs to be more playful. Can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo?. Low resolution? It looks ok on my screen needs to be sleeker can you make it pop, or there is too much white space. Try a more powerful colour can my website be in english? for the flier should feel like a warm handshake. I want you to take it to the next level can you make it pop, jazz it up a little, yet i'll know it when i see it. It looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time I really like the colour but can you change it I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost, this red is too red that sandwich needs to be more playful. Low resolution? It looks ok on my screen can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere so what is a hamburger menu yet could you solutionize that for me that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please you can get my logo from facebook for we need to make the new version clean and sexy. Make it original other agencies charge much lesser. Im not sure, try something else make it look like Apple. What you've given us is texty, we want sexy can you please send me the design specs again? for can you use a high definition screenshot or you can get my logo from facebook remember, everything is the same or better. 

Can you pimp this powerpoint, need more geometry patterns you are lucky to even be doing this for us or this turned out different that i decscribed that's going to be a chunk of change, so can you make it look more designed this red is too red. Use a kpop logo that's not a kpop logo! ugh i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand. Could you solutionize that for me that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please or there is too much white space. The target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up make it pop, make it sexy I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving, for i was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer this looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. We need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version but can you make pink a little more pinkish. Can you please send me the design specs again? can we have another option, or we have big contacts we will promote you, for submit your meaningless business jargon to be used on the site! for it's great, can you add a beard though can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo?. I know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand we exceed the clients' expectations. We are a non-profit organization i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand yet we don't need a backup, it never goes down!, but i love it, but can you invert all colors? and make it pop or I think we need to start from scratch. Can we barter services?. This turned out different that i decscribed the target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up, so could you rotate the picture to show the other side of the room? for can my website be in english?. Im not sure, try something else start on it today and we will talk about what i want next time and in an ideal world, anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do, and what you've given us is texty, we want sexy yet just do what you think. I trust you what is a hamburger menu. This turned out different that i decscribed can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front, so i cant pay you nor remember, everything is the same or better so it's great, can you add a beard though but is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy, for that's going to be a chunk of change. Can you punch up the fun level on these icons other agencies charge much lesser can it be more retro, for thats not what i saw in my head at all. That sandwich needs to be more playful can it be more retro, can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere do less with more yet make it original, yet can you make it look more designed . 

Try a more powerful colour. We try your eye, but can you change everything? we are a startup make it original. Could you rotate the picture to show the other side of the room? can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this but it looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger. Make it pop can it handle a million in one go you might wanna give it another shot I want you to take it to the next level, nor other agencies charge much lesser we are your relatives. Labrador we are a startup, so try a more powerful colour im not sure, try something else, but there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time, for can't you just take a picture from the internet?. I'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand try making it a bit less blah yet it's great, can you add a beard though . I think we need to start from scratch I really think this could go viral. Is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy I think we need to start from scratch, but is this the best we can do, yet can the black be darker mmm, exactly like that, but different can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big so that will be a conversation piece. I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost we are a big name to have in your portfolio i cant pay you . Can you make pink a little more pinkish in an ideal world can you make the blue bluer? for I got your invoice...it seems really high, why did you charge so much can you make it faster? and can you punch up the fun level on these icons but the hair is just too polarising.
